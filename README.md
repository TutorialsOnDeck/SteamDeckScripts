# SteamDeckScripts
I've only been using linux as a daily driver since Valve announced the Steam Deck in summer of 2021. 
Turns out I love everything about Linux and I have Valve to thank for giving me that push I needed to get rid of Microsoft.

If my scripts appear somewhat crude, Apologies. They can't be that bad though; none of them have ever broken any installs and both my parents (in their 70's)
use Arch BTW, with my scripts keeping everything running smooth for them. They even installed Arch themselves (with my scripts as guidance).

You are free to take any script and modify it for your own needs / use it as you please. After all, the real heroes are the FOSS project devs.
